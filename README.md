# Learning AI & AL
This repository serves as a personal workspace for practicing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. It contains code implementations, Jupyter notebooks, and small projects exploring fundamental ML algorithms, neural networks, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and other AI concepts as I learn them. It's a living log of my hands-on experience.
